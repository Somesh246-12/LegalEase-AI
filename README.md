## 🧠 Risk Analysis Overview

- Located alongside the summary, the **Risk Analysis** pane lists extracted risks as items with:

  - **Clause**: short quote or heading

  - **Issue**: what could go wrong

  - **Severity**: Low / Medium / High (machine‑readable values; color‑coded)

  - **Suggestion**: practical mitigation or redline idea

- The selected output language applies to risk text as well (e.g., Marathi labels and content), while severity values remain consistent internally.

### Colors

- High: red

- Medium: yellow

- Low: green

### Tips & Troubleshooting

- If the risk panel shows “No obvious risks detected”:

  - Provide more context or a larger portion of the contract.

  - Ensure `credentials.json` is valid and the Vertex AI model is reachable.

- If risk items appear misaligned, ensure you’re on the latest build; the app normalizes markdown to avoid stray bullets and extra spacing.

## 💻 How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS / Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(It's recommended to have these in a `requirements.txt` file)*
    ```sh
    pip install Flask google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-vision PyPDF2 Markdown
    ```

4.  **Set up Google Cloud Credentials:**
    -   Follow the Google Cloud documentation to create a **service account**.
    -   Grant the service account the **`Editor`** role for your project.
    -   Download the JSON key for the service account and save it in your project folder as `credentials.json`.

5.  **Secure Your Credentials:**
    -   Create a `.gitignore` file in your project folder.
    -   Add `credentials.json` to this file to prevent your secret key from being uploaded to GitHub.

6.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
